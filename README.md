## Dependencies:
- pandas
- turtle (Python libraries)

## Description:
`usStateGame.py` is a simple Python game where users guess the names of US states and see their names appear on a map if the guess is correct. The game uses turtle graphics to display a background map of the US with state names positioned at the correct coordinates. 

The user is prompted to enter a state, and if the entered state is valid, the game will display that state's name at the corresponding coordinates on the map.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/US-State-Game.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd US-State-Game
```
Run the script:

```bash
python usStateGame.py
```
The script will show a background map and prompt you to enter US states. When you enter a valid state name, it will appear at the corresponding position on the map.

## Example Output:
Enter an US State: California

(The name "California" is displayed at the correct coordinates on the map)

How it works:
The game uses turtle graphics to display a background map of the United States.

The user is prompted to input a state name.

The script checks if the state name is valid by comparing it to a list of states.

If the state is found, the name is displayed at the correct position on the map.
